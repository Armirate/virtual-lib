# Virtual Library

I want to propose the idea of developing Virtual Library as a web application for searching, tracking, and storing book information in a local machine using API from the internet to get desired book information. 

My initial idea was to have the query data stored in the clientâ€™s web browser, but if it works, we can expand the features for online sharing web blog on book review.

## Purpose for this idea?

Appeal to book enthusiastics.

Local library for storing book information query and review.

(For developer) learning more about web app development using simple HTML, CSS, Reacts, Python, and Database.

## Main features for this application

Book (Shelf) Management

Search Functionality

API Integrations using Open Library API

User Authentication - Advanced

User profiles pages - More advanced

## Full-Stack Process (from ChatGPT)

Frontend - React or Next.js

Backend - Django

Database - SQL

API - Open Library API or Google Book API for searching and indexing

Network - idk

## Can the idea be growing into something more?

Yes, book review blog, and user recommendations, with user profiles with stat on the book which they have read. We can also turn this virtual library into other topics like anime storage, music, games, etc.
